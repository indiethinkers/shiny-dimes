    "summary": "A dramatic shift in work attitudes has emerged among young people since 2020, backed by decades of survey data. Jean M. Twenge reveals how Gen Z's willingness to work overtime plunged from 54% to 36% between 2020-2022, marking historic lows in work motivation. The research shows today's 18-year-olds are less focused on career centrality, less willing to work without financial need, and surprisingly unconcerned about how their reduced work ethic might impact their job prospects. This shift could stem from pandemic burnout, cultural pessimism, or changing views about capitalism.",

    "summary": "The essay traces a journey through epistemic anxiety, capitalism, ignorance, and responsibility toward intellectual fulfillment. Its metaphorical landscapes and tools—like the Axe of Satisfaction and Torch of Curiosity—illustrate how diverse ideas and disciplined curiosity lead to emergence. Stories of thinkers like Hodgkin, Zhang, and Erdős show that truth-seeking requires humility, collaboration, and the courage to start over.",
    "quote": "Our ideas, like life itself, flourish not through isolated brilliance but through emergence—born from diverse, abundant inputs and sustained by curiosity, routine, and the courage to begin again.",
